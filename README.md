What is AKCB-Project doing? 
This project is a testing project. It is to create avatars of AKCB (https://www.akidcalledbeast.com/) for play in metaverse. 
The wearables on AKCB are expected to be ripped off from the origal 3D models and sent to the project, which can be worn by other AKCB avatars. 
The procedures: The contributors adjust the AKCB pose into A-Pose or T-Pose, rig the A-Pose/T-Pose AKCB model onto the skeleton we provided, and rip the wearables including rigged models, clothes, pants, headgear, shoes etc as independent files. 
These files should be given to us as final deliverables to contact@ipollo.org The award of 15U or 100RMB per AKCB avatar will be given to the contributor upon receipt of the deliverables
